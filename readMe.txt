My project is loosely inspired by turn-based dungeon crawler games. In this grid-based game, the player (the blue circle) moves using arrow keys, navigating around a randomly generated map to find the goal (the yellow square). While doing this, the player must also avoid two types of enemies: the purple enemies are called "glitches" because they randomly jump to any square within four coordinates of its position and move through walls. The red enemies are called "chasers" because they move in the direction of the player. The chasers are somewhat overpowered because they can move diagonally around walls, so they can get around obstacles fairly quickly. If the player runs into an enemy, the game is over and a message will display how the player died. As time passes, the number of enemies increases, making the game more difficult. The user can press the space bar to pause the game (although the timer continues - which is fine, because the game is independent of the timer). 
My original idea was to have the enemies move as the player moves, so it's actually turn-based, but I gave up on that to make the setTimeout aspect of the program more obvious. I had also planned on drawing the map myself, but I didn't have time, so I kept the random map but decreased the wall density so it's less likely that the player can't reach the goal. 
If I had more time, I would adjust the timer so that it pauses with the rest of the game. I would also make it so that if the player reaches the goal without dying, the game resets, but enemies spawn or move faster - and the "level" increases in difficulty. I was also hoping to add another enemy type ("slimes") that moves in a set direction, rather than randomly or chasing the player. Lastly, I would've liked to play around with the layout/style of the page a little more.
