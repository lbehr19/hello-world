Created in collaboration with Anthony Lee and Arya Burke. 
Group project guidelines: Create a web-based database
prompt: Implement the 'rating system' from the Netflix show Black Mirror episode 'Nosedive'

My primary duties, as part of this group project, were to implement the database and the Python host programs into a web-based user
interface using Flask. Initially, I attempted to create the project as a package, but in order to host it on the school servers I had
to keep the code to a single file. The program itself can be demo'd at http://science.slc.edu/faces/

Things to improve:
-Obviously, the interface is still rather clunky, and there is no mobile version.
-Database changes may be required to help display individual ratings/emojies in a more user-friendly manner. 
-Minor bugs still exist, i.e. empty comments displaying on the user page
