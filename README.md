# hello-world
This is my code portfolio, showcasing projects that I have developed alone or in a group throughout my college career.
All of these projects (with the exception of the RISC-V simulation software) were developed as academic projects, with or without specific guidelines from a professor. If you have questions about any of the code, feel free to contact me at 15behrleah@gmail.com.

I started coding in 2017 when I began taking computer science courses in college. In the course of my studies, I've become an excellent writer and researcher, and I have gained general knowledge on a wide variety of CS topics, including databases, AI, programming languages, and computer organization. 

In the course of my studies, I have created programs in the following languages:
  Python
  Java 
  JavaScript (with HTML and CSS)
  Scheme
  SQL (using Python as a host language)
  MIPS assembly language
  RISC-V assembly language
  C (very briefly)
  
I have become familiar with specific packages including Keras (Tensorflow), SQLite3, BeautifulSoup, and some of the Flask packages.
I am also very adept with the JavaFX library. 

Not all of the programs I've created are notable enough to be shared here, but I will be including a Javascript project, two examples of Java-based software, and three Python programs. 
  
Over the summer of 2018, I worked on a project with my professor and two of my classmates to create a version of the Mars software, but for RISC-V assembly language instead of MIPS. This software also had the capability to allow users to program in custom languages; we came up with our own such assembly language for beginners called YAAL. My responsibility in this project was mainly the user interface. Our project, like Mars, was created using Java (with a lot of help from the JavaFX library). 
A walkthrough of the software's UI can be found at http://science.slc.edu/scirvy/
