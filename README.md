# hello-world
This is for my hobbies (incomplete projects)

My name is Leah Behr. I'm a recent graduate of Sarah Lawrence College (BA) and I am working on becoming familiar with GitHub as a way to show off some of the code I've made while learning to program at school. 

I started coding in 2017 when I began taking computer science courses in college. In the course of my studies, I've become an excellent writer and researcher, and I have gained general knowledge on a wide variety of CS topics, including databases, AI, programming languages, and computer organization. 

In the course of my studies, I have created programs in the following languages:
  Python
  Java 
  JavaScript (with HTML and CSS)
  Scheme
  SQL (using Python as a host language)
  MIPS assembly language
  RISC-V assembly language
  C (very briefly)
  
I have become familiar with specific packages including Keras (Tensorflow), SQLite3, BeautifulSoup, and some of the Flask packages.
I am also very adept with the JavaFX library. 

Not all of the programs I've created are notable enough to be shared here, but I will be including a Javascript game, two examples of Java-based software, and three Python programs. 
  
Over the summer of 2018, I worked on a project with my professor and two of my classmates to create a version of the Mars software, but for RISC-V assembly language instead of MIPS. This software also had the capability to allow users to program in custom languages; we came up with our own such assembly language for beginners called YAAL. My responsibility in this project was mainly the user interface. Our project, like Mars, was created using Java (with a lot of help from the JavaFX library). 

Note to self: locations of these programs. 
Javascript game is on my Google Drive (IWP 17 Final Project)
Java game is on my Desktop (CS programs\DS18\DS18ConferenceGame, see game4.25.18)
Summer Research software is on GitLab somewhere (ask Mike?--link: http://science.slc.edu/scirvy/)
Text game is in PRGLANG18\Text Game
Faces is in DB19\web-db\faces\FINAL
SmartLib is in DB19\db-conference\final-turn-in
